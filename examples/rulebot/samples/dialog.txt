C: What would you like to do?
H: I'd like to create an event rule

-- Rule construction workspace
C: Sure, when is that rule triggered?
H: It is triggered by a transaction   H: It is triggered when a transaction arrives
  C: Ok, I'll call that 'the transaction', is that ok?
  H: Sounds good.
C: Are there conditions that apply on 'the transaction'?
H: Yes, the transaction should not be in the United States
C: Ok, any other condition?
H: It should be more than 1000
H: Ok, the amount should be more than a 1000, is that right?
C: Yes.
H: Any other condition?
C: No that's it.
H: Ok, so that's what I have so far:
```
when a transaction occurs , called 'the transaction'
if
    the country code of 'the transaction' is not "US"
    and the amount of 'the transaction' is more than 1000
```
now what should happen when that event occurs?
C: You should emit a new authorization
H: Ok, you mean a new 'authorization response'?
C: Yep.
H: An 'authorization response' has three fields: an account, a message, and a transaction. How are those filled?
C: The account and the transaction is that of the transaction.
H: OK, what about the message?
C: The messages should be the string "R01: Out of country transaction greater than 1000"
H: That's complicated, but ok. Does the final rule look right to you?
C: Pretty much, thank you.
