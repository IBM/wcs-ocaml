# SDK and command line interface for Watson Conversation Service

wcs-ocaml is a source development kit in OCaml and command line interface for
[Watson Conversation Service (WCS)](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/conversation/). It allows to program chat bots in OCaml.

* `wcs-lib` provides a framework to write WCS programs, called
  workspaces.
* `wcs-api` offers an OCaml binding to the
  [service API](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/conversation/api/v1/)
  and a generic client application.
* `wcs` is a command line tool that interact with the service.

# Quick install with Opam

The easiest way to install wcs-ocaml is through the Opam package manager for OCaml.
Instructions to install Opam on you system can be found on the website:
http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html

Then you can install wcs-ocaml with the following command:
```
opam install wcs
```

This will install the three main packages:
- wcs-lib,
- wcs-api, and,
- wcs

Alternatively, you can only install the WCS API:
```
opam install wcs-api
```

or the Ocaml SDK (which will also install the api):
```
opam install wcs-lib
```

## Building from source
### Prerequistes

To build from source, you will need:
- OCaml 4.04 or later (http://ocaml.org/) along with the following libraries:
  - ocamlfind, a library manager (http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html)
  - jbuilder, a build system (https://github.com/janestreet/jbuilder)
  - atdgen, a json parser generator (https://github.com/mjambon/atdgen)
  - cohttp, HTTPS client (https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp)
  - sedlex, a lexer that supports Unicode (https://github.com/alainfrisch/sedlex)
  - menhir, a parser generator (http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/)

An easy way to get set up on most platforms is to use the OCaml
package manager (https://opam.ocaml.org). Once opam is installed, you
can just add the corresponding libraries:
```
opam install ocamlfind jbuilder atdgen
opam install lwt_ssl cohttp-lwt-unix
opam install sedlex menhir
```

### Compiling

To compile, do:

```
make
```

## Watson Conversation Service command line interface

The compilation produces a command line interface for Watson
Conversation Service in:

```
./_build/install/default/bin/wcs
```

The command line interface support the following commands:
  * `list` - List the workspaces associated with a Conversation service instance.
  * `create` - Create workspaces on the Conversation service instance.
  * `delete` - Delete workspaces from the Conversation service instance.
  * `get` - Get information about workspaces, optionally including all workspace contents.
  * `update` - Update an existing workspace with new or modified data.
  * `try` - Generic bot running in the terminal.


All commands require to get the Watson Conversation Service
credentials. They should be stored in a JSON file with the following
structure
([getting credentials](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/common/getting-started-credentials.html)):

```js
{
  "url": "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/conversation/api",
  "password": "PASSWORD",
  "username": "USERNAME"
}
```

The path to this JSON file can be provided either with the option
`-wcs-cred` or through the environment variable `WCS_CRED`.



### The `list` command

List the workspaces associated with a Conversation service instance.

```
Usage:
  wcs list [options]
Options:
  -page_limit n       The number of records to return in each page of results.
  -include_count b    Whether to include information about the number of records returned.
  -sort attr          The attribute by which returned results will be sorted. To reverse the sort order, prefix the value with a minus sign (-). Supported values are name, modified, and workspace_id.
  -cursor token       A token identifying the last value from the previous page of results.
  -short              Display ony workspace ids and names.
  -wcs-cred cred.json The file containing the Watson Conversation Service credentials.
  -version            Print the Watson Conversation API version number used.
  -no-error-recovery  Do not try to recover in case of error.
  -debug              Print debug messages.
  -help               Display this list of options
  ```

The command `ls` is a synonym for the command `list -short`.


### The `create` command

Create workspaces on the Conversation service instance.

```
Usage:
  wcs create [options] [workspace.json ...]
Options:
  -wcs-cred cred.json The file containing the Watson Conversation Service credentials.
  -version            Print the Watson Conversation API version number used.
  -no-error-recovery  Do not try to recover in case of error.
  -debug              Print debug messages.
  -help               Display this list of options
```

### The `delete` command
